# MY BITCOIN APP

The web app will serve as where you can view your wallet, buy and sell your Crytpocurreny,
displaying the market update of each coin and the crypto widget coin marquee.

 ## DESIGN CONCEPT

The web app will be responsive to mobile and desktop alike. it should have a navigation system and a herosection consisting of a responsive logo icon aligned at the left.

The Navigation system should have a "Home Page, Registration Page, Login Page,Contact us and a Dashboard..

** NOTE: About Us is not linking anywhere and also the Contact Us should be a Dropdown and inside the dropdown should have 3 social icons linking to different personal social media handles.

In the Hero Section we will be using the grid in Bootstrap that is "col-12 col-md-6", which on Screen it will be divided into 2 in Desktop and it will be single on Mobile.

In the Left Grid ther will be an image with "animation bounce" and in the right will carry our text "PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS IN CRYPTOCURRENCY",with a catch text "Buy and Sell Cryptocurrency" under it..And right under the text ther will have another grid "col-12 col-md-6" that will service as button linking to nowhere.

After the hero section there will be a "crypto-widget-CoinMarquee" and under it you will see on grid in Boostrap "col-12 col-md-6" showing the "MARKET UPDATE" with an image on the left and the "crypto-widget-CoinList" on the right displaying the amount and the percentage of each coin daily.
 
 while also you have on grid col-md-4 which on PC will be 3per row while on Mobile it will display single the "Steps on How the Crypto Works" "Why Choose Us"

 ** Note: theres a Step guiding you on How it Works and with an hover effects on each when click on it.. while no hover effects on Why choose us.

 Then again you have a grid "col-12 col-md-6" that will service as button linking to somewhere on how to Register and Trade your coin....Right under it, we have 4 social icons linking to different personal social media handles.
